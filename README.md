# Online Curriculum Vitae

This repository contains a **React** project with my **CV**. 

It is **highly reusable**, changing the data in `public/mockups/cv_data.json.`
Generate a PDF based on a set of react components with `react-pdf`.

Feel free to **fork this project** and customize it ;)

P.D:  *There are many things to improve, if you want to give me a hand, I would appreciate if you could open an issue, or directly ask me for a PR.*
